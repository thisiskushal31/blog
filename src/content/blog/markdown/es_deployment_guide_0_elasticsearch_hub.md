## Technical Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge Base
- **Basic:** Command line usage, YAML configuration (seriously, you'll write a lot of YAML)
- **Intermediate:** Docker concepts, API usage, Linux administration (know your way around `htop` and `iostat`)
- **Advanced:** Kubernetes, infrastructure automation, performance tuning (and the patience to debug distributed systems)

### Setup Requirements
- **Local Development:** Docker Desktop or native Elasticsearch installation (start with Docker‚Äîit's less painful)
- **Cloud Deployment:** Access to cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) and a budget (cloud costs add up fast)
- **Kubernetes:** Cluster access with admin permissions (and a good understanding of persistent volumes)
- **Self-Managed:** VM or bare metal server access (and a strong coffee supply for those late-night debugging sessions)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Memory allocation:** Don't give Elasticsearch more than 50% of your available RAM (it will crash)
- **Disk space:** Always leave 20% free disk space (Elasticsearch stops working when full)
- **Network configuration:** Get your cluster discovery settings right the first time (recovery is painful)
- **Security:** Enable authentication from day one (retrofitting security is a nightmare)
