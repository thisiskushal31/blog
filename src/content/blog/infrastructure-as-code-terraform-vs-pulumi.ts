## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern cloud deployments. Two popular tools dominate this space: Terraform and Pulumi.

## Terraform: The Declarative Approach

### Strengths

- **Mature ecosystem** with extensive provider support
- **Large community** and comprehensive documentation
- **Declarative syntax** using HCL
- **State management** with remote backends

### Example

\`\`\`hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Pulumi: The Programming Approach

### Strengths

- **Real programming languages** (TypeScript, Python, Go, C#)
- **Better testing capabilities**
- **IDE support** with intellisense
- **Policy as code** with CrossGuard

### Example

\`\`\`typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const server = new aws.ec2.Instance("web-server", {
    ami: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0",
    instanceType: "t2.micro",
    tags: {
        Name: "HelloWorld",
    },
});
\`\`\`

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Terraform | Pulumi |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Easy for developers |
| Language Support | HCL only | Multiple languages |
| State Management | Built-in | Service-based |
| Testing | Limited | Full unit testing |
| Community | Large | Growing |

## When to Choose What?

### Choose Terraform if:
- You prefer declarative configuration
- You need maximum provider coverage
- Your team is comfortable with HCL

### Choose Pulumi if:
- You want to use familiar programming languages
- Testing is a priority
- You need complex logic in your infrastructure code

## Conclusion

Both tools are excellent choices. Your decision should be based on team preferences, existing skills, and specific project requirements.`
