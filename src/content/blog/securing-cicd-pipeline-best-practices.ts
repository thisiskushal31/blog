## Why Pipeline Security Matters

Modern CI/CD pipelines are critical infrastructure that can be targeted by attackers. A compromised pipeline can lead to supply chain attacks affecting your entire organization.

## Key Security Measures

### 1. Secure Your Source Code

\`\`\`bash
# Use signed commits
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
\`\`\`

### 2. Implement Secrets Management

Never hardcode secrets in your pipeline files:

\`\`\`yaml
# Good - Using environment variables
- name: Deploy to production
  env:
    API_KEY: \${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    DB_PASSWORD: \${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
\`\`\`

### 3. Use Minimal Permissions

Apply the principle of least privilege:

- Use specific service accounts
- Limit repository access
- Implement time-based access controls

### 4. Scan for Vulnerabilities

\`\`\`yaml
- name: Security Scan
  uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-add-sarif@v1
  with:
    sarif-file: 'security-scan-results.sarif'
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Alerting

Set up comprehensive monitoring:

1. **Pipeline execution logs**
2. **Failed authentication attempts**
3. **Unusual deployment patterns**
4. **Resource access anomalies**

## Conclusion

Security in CI/CD is not optionalâ€”it is essential for protecting your software supply chain.`
