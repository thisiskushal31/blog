Create a simple, clean, professional technical blog cover thumbnail image
with exact dimensions 1536×1024 pixels.

Core visual style (must remain consistent across all images):
- Clean white or very light neutral background
- Flat, modern, minimalist illustration
- Editorial / technical design aesthetic
- Calm, uncluttered composition with clear visual hierarchy

Layout (flexible):
- Use any layout appropriate for the topic (split comparison, hub-and-spoke, grid, flow, or abstract arrangement)
- Layout must feel balanced, intentional, and professional
- Avoid unnecessary decorative elements

Icons & elements:
- Use recognizable technology logos and technical icons only
- Icons must be clearly separated with generous spacing
- No overlapping elements, no crowding
- Maintain consistent icon sizing and visual weight

Color discipline:
- Use official brand colors for logos
- Keep background neutral and uncluttered
- Use subtle color grouping only when it helps convey structure
- Avoid heavy gradients, neon colors, or dark themes

Visual language rules:
- Prefer simple geometric shapes
- Use thin lines, dividers, or connectors only if they add meaning
- Maintain a cohesive, scalable visual system

CRITICAL constraints (non-negotiable):
- NO text anywhere in the image
- No titles, labels, captions, or annotations
- No words or letters of any kind
- Logos are allowed even if they contain inherent text

Quality bar:
- Must look suitable for a senior-level technical blog
- Consistent across a long-running content series
- Clean and readable at thumbnail size
