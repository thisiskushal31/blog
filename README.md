## üìù How to Add a New Blog Post

1.  **Create Markdown:**
    - Add your post as a `.md` file in `src/content/blog/markdown/` (e.g., `my-post.md`).

2.  **Create TypeScript Wrapper:**
    - Add a `.ts` file in `src/content/blog/` (e.g., `my-post.ts`) that imports the markdown and exports a `blogPost` object.

3.  **Register the Post:**
    - In `src/config/blogPosts.config.ts`:
        - Import your new post at the top.
        - Add the slug to `BLOG_POST_SLUGS`.
        - Add the post to `POST_MAP`.

4.  **Done!**
    - The post will now appear in the blog.

(See the public repo for a full example if needed.)
